Privileged mode should only be set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon fails.                                                   |
| AwsSolutions-CB5  | The Codebuild project does not use images provided by the CodeBuild service or have a cdk_nag suppression rule explaining the need for a custom image. | Explaining differences/edits to Docker images helps operators better understand system dependencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The DynamoDB service can back up the data with per-second granularity and restore it to any single second from the time PITR was enabled up to the prior 35 days.                |
| AwsSolutions-KDA3 | The Kinesis Data Analytics Flink Application does not have checkpointing enabled.                                                                      | Checkpoints are backups of application state that KDA automatically creates periodically and uses to restore from faults.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| AwsSolutions-VPC3 | A Network ACL or Network ACL entry has been implemented.                                                                                               | Network ACLs should be used sparingly for the following reasons: they can be complex to manage, they are stateless, every IP address must be explicitly opened in each (inbound/outbound) direction, and they affect a complete subnet. Use security groups when possible as they are stateful and easier to manage. |
