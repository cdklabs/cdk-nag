### Warnings

| Rule ID           | Cause                                                                                                                                                  | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| AwsSolutions-CB3  | The CodeBuild project has privileged mode enabled.                                                                                                     | Privileged grants elevated rights to the system, which introduces additional risk. Privileged mode should only be set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the Docker daemon fails.                                                   |
| AwsSolutions-CB5  | The Codebuild project does not use images provided by the CodeBuild service or have a cdk_nag suppression rule explaining the need for a custom image. | Explaining differences/edits to Docker images helps operators better understand system dependencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| AwsSolutions-CFR1 | The CloudFront distribution may require Geo restrictions.                                                                                              | Geo restriction may need to be enabled for the distribution in order to allow or deny a country in order to allow or restrict users in specific locations from accessing content.                                                                                                                                    |
| AwsSolutions-CFR2 | The CloudFront distribution may require integration with AWS WAF.                                                                                      | The Web Application Firewall can help protect against application-layer attacks that can compromise the security of the system or place unnecessary load on them.                                                                                                                                                    |
| AwsSolutions-COG2 | The Cognito user pool does not require MFA.                                                                                                            | Multi-factor authentication (MFA) increases security for the application by adding another authentication method, and not relying solely on user name and password.                                                                                                                                                  |
| AwsSolutions-DDB3 | The DynamoDB table does not have Point-in-time Recovery enabled.                                                                                       | DynamoDB continuous backups represent an additional layer of insurance against accidental loss of data on top of on-demand backups. The DynamoDB service can back up the data with per-second granularity and restore it to any single second from the time PITR was enabled up to the prior 35 days.                |
| AwsSolutions-KDA3 | The Kinesis Data Analytics Flink Application does not have checkpointing enabled.                                                                      | Checkpoints are backups of application state that KDA automatically creates periodically and uses to restore from faults.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| AwsSolutions-MS4  | The MediaStore container does not define a metric policy to send metrics to CloudWatch.                                                                | Using a combination of MediaStore metrics and CloudWatch alarms helps operators gain better insights into container operations.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| AwsSolutions-MS7  | The MediaStore container does not define a container policy.                                                                                           | Using a container policy helps follow the standard security advice of granting least privilege, or granting only the permissions required to allow needed access to the container.                                                                                                                                   |

| AwsSolutions-MS10 | The MediaStore container does not define a lifecycle policy.                                                                                           | Many use cases warrant the usage of lifecycle configurations to manage container objects during their lifetime.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| AwsSolutions-VPC3 | A Network ACL or Network ACL entry has been implemented.                                                                                               | Network ACLs should be used sparingly for the following reasons: they can be complex to manage, they are stateless, every IP address must be explicitly opened in each (inbound/outbound) direction, and they affect a complete subnet. Use security groups when possible as they are stateful and easier to manage. |

## Footnotes

<a id="dynamodb-table-encrypted-kms">1</a>: This rule is intentionally unimplemented. Server-side encryption at rest is enabled on all DynamoDB table data and [cannot be disabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/encryption.usagenotes.html#encryption.usagenotes.tabledata).

<a id="vpc-sg-open-only-to-authorized-ports">2</a>: This rule is intentionally unimplemented. The implementation of this rule is highly dependent upon organizational requirements.
